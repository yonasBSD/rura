Rura transforms the tedious "edit, up-arrow, rerun" shell cycle into a fluid, interactive TUI scratchpad. It features live previews, syntax highlighting, and partial execution, allowing you to debug and iterate on commands in real time.

## Features

- **Partial Pipeline Execution**: Execute only up to the current subcommand to debug complex pipes.
- **Context-aware Completion**: Tab-complete commands and file paths using your system's bash, zsh, or fish tools.
- **Custom Shell Support**: Specify which shell to use for command execution and completions (supports `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` on Unix and `powershell` on Windows).
- **Live Execution Modes**: Real-time feedback as you type, with optional "Live Until Cursor" or "Live Full" modes.
- **Search**: Search and highlight text within the output pane with regex support.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Visual feedback for subcommand boundaries, quotes, and pipes.
- **Error Highlighting**: Highlights the failed subcommand in the input field.
- **Command Caching**: Automatically caches output of subcommands to speed up iteration.
- **Command Formatting**: Automatically format your command pipeline.
- **Subcommand Editing**: Quick copy, cut, and paste of subcommands.
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual indicator for long-running commands.
- **Persistent History**: Quickly access and reuse previous commands.
- **Save to File**: Save current output or command to a file.
- **Line Wrapping**: Toggle whether long output lines wrap to fit the view.
- **Customizable**: Fully configurable key bindings, themes, and UI placement via TOML.

## Configuration

Rura can be configured via a TOML file. The shell used by Rura is determined by (in order of priority):
1. The `--shell` (or `-s`) CLI argument.
2. The `shell` property in the configuration file.
3. The `SHELL` environment variable.
4. Default to `sh`.

The configuration path is determined as follows:
1. Path specified by the `--config` (or `-C`) CLI argument.
2. Path specified by the `RURA_CONFIG` environment variable.
3. Default path:
    - **Linux**: `~/.config/rura/config.toml`
    - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/rura/config.toml`
    - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\rura\config.toml`

### General Options

- `command_line_placement`: Set to `"top"` or `"bottom"` (default) to change where the input field is rendered.
- `highlight_duration_ms`: Duration in milliseconds for the temporary highlighting when executing commands (default: `250`).
- `debounce_duration_ms`: Duration in milliseconds to wait before executing commands in live mode (default: `500`).
- `shell`: The shell to use for execution and completions (e.g., `"bash"`, `"zsh"`, `"fish"`).
- `no_cache`: Disable caching of command output when set to `true` (default: `false`).
- `log_level`: Set the logging level (e.g., `"info"`, `"debug"`, `"error"`). Default is `"info"`.

### Customizing Key Bindings

You can override any default key binding in the `[keybindings]` section. Multiple keys can be assigned to the same action.

```toml
[keybindings]
quit = ["ctrl+q", "ctrl+c"]
execute_full = ["enter"]
complete = ["tab"]
complete_prev = ["shift+tab"]
subcommand_next = ["alt+right"]
```

### Customizing Theme

Colors and styles can be adjusted in the `[theme]` section. Supported colors include `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `gray`, `black`, `white`, and hex codes (e.g., `"#ffffff"`).

Available theme keys:
- `cmd_regular`: Default subcommand style.
- `cmd_regular_pipe`: Style for the pipe character in regular mode.
- `cmd_regular_current`: Background style for the currently selected subcommand.
- `cmd_highlight`: Style for the subcommand being executed.
- `cmd_highlight_pipe`: Style for the pipe character during execution.
- `cmd_highlight_current`: Style for the current subcommand during execution.
- `cmd_quoted`: Style for quoted strings.
- `cmd_invalid`: Style for invalid subcommands (if parsing fails).
- `output_highlight`: Style for search results in the output.
- `output_highlight_current`: Style for the currently selected search result.
- `line_nums`: Style for line numbers in the output.
- `popup`: Style for popups (e.g., help, save, live mode confirmation).

```toml
[theme.cmd_highlight]
fg = "black"
bg = "yellow"
bold = true

[theme.line_nums]
fg = "magenta"
```
